# OpenSimulator helpers Binaries

Pre-built binaries for the modules needed by the helpers. Download the dlls according to your OpenSim version and place them in the base of your OpenSimulator bin/ directory (not in subfolders).

_This folder is not needed in your website, you can safely delete it after copying the needed files to your OpenSim server._

If you don't find a version for your setup, you can drop us a note, we might add pre-built binaries you need to the repository (if it's not too old).

Alternatively, you can build the binaries from sources.
