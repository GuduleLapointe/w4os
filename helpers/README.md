Collection of PHP scripts to complement OpenSimulator features.

## Description

Collection of PHP scripts to enable OpenSimulator features that are not implemented in the core, like search, currency, events in OpenSimulator grids (see Features below).

Most files are used directly by viewer to allow features not implemented in OpenSimulator, like classifieds, events, etc.

They were initially based on a collection of different projects (see Credits below), but were entirely rewritten to use an unified code and set of parameters, as well as for integration in larger projects like [w4os OpenSim WordPress Interface](https://w4os.org/).

Formerly known as Flexible Helper Scripts.

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, please see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

If you encounter issues during installation or usage, please refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Just enable in-world search (no helpers installation)

If you only need basic in-world search, you can use an external service like [2do directory](http://2do.directory/) without installing the helpers.

1. Download [OpenSimSearch.Module.dll](https://github.com/magicoli/opensim-helpers/tree/master/bin) and put it inside your OpenSim bin/ folder.

2. Add search settings to OpenSim.ini:
  ```
  [Search]
  SearchURL = "https://2do.directory/helpers/query.php?gk=${Const|BaseURL}:${Const|PublicPort}"

  [DataSnapshot]
  index_sims = true
  gridname = "Your Grid"
  snapshot_cache_directory = "./DataSnapshot"
  DATA_SRV_2do = http://2do.directory/helpers/register.php
  ```

3. Restart the simulators.

#### Option 2: WordPress website

If you have a WordPress website, we recommend installing [W4OS Plugin](https://w4os.org/) which includes these helpers along with many other features like avatar registration and web profiles.

#### Option 3: Full helpers installation

For a complete installation with all features (search, currency, events, etc.), see the detailed instructions in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).
