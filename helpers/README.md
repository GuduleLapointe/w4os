A compilation of scripts to complement OpenSimulator services or external modules:

- In-world Search
- Currency
- Offline messaging (with mail forwarding)
- Events

Flexible helper scripts include new code and code rewritten from several sources, in the hope to ease their integration within another platform (e.g. in a WordPress plugin like W4OS).

While most of the code has been created or rewritten from scratch, portions of code may remain from the legacy projects, including:

- [Speculoos' Flexible helper scripts](https://github.com/GuduleLapointe/flexible_helper_scripts)
- [2do HYPEvents](https://2do.pm)
- [OpenSimSearch](https://github.com/kcozens/OpenSimSearch)
- [DTL/NSL Money Server for OpenSim](http://www.nsl.tuis.ac.jp/xoops/modules/xpwiki/?OpenSim%2FMoneyServer)
- [DTL/NSL Helper scripts](http://www.nsl.tuis.ac.jp/xoops/modules/xpwiki/?OpenSim%2FMoneyServer%2FHelper%20Script)
- [OpenSimMaps](https://github.com/hawddamor/opensimmaps)
- [Offline Messaging](http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Offline_Messaging)
