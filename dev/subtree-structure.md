# Subtree Conversion Complete

The nested submodule structure has been successfully converted to subtrees:

- helpers/ (was submodule) → now subtree
- helpers/engine/ (was nested submodule) → now embedded in helpers subtree  
- helpers/engine/opensim-rest/ (was deeply nested submodule) → now embedded in engine subtree

## Testing subtree push capabilities:

You can now push changes to any level:

```bash
# Push to the main helpers repo
git subtree push --prefix=helpers https://github.com/GuduleLapointe/opensim-helpers 3.x

# Push to the nested engine repo  
git subtree push --prefix=helpers/engine https://github.com/GuduleLapointe/opensim-engine 3.x

# Push to the deeply nested opensim-rest repo
git subtree push --prefix=helpers/engine/opensim-rest https://github.com/GuduleLapointe/opensim-rest-php 3.x
```

## Benefits achieved:

✅ No more checkout conflicts with historical commits
✅ Simplified workflow - no submodule update commands needed
✅ Can push changes at any nesting level
✅ Complete history preserved in main repo
✅ Works seamlessly with different branches (3.x vs 2.x)
