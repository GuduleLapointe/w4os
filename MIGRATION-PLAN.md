  - Curating essential OpenSim parameters for plugin/helpers usage
  - Filtering out unnecessary OpenSim config for focused functionality

**ðŸ“‹ NEXT PRIORITIES:**
1. **Complete Phase 4**: INI Import Strategy & Parameter Curation
   - Align INI importation with constants/WP import patterns
   - Identify and document core OpenSim parameters actually used
   - Create curated parameter set for focused functionality
2. **Phase 5**: Multi-Step Installation/Migration Wizard
   - User-friendly wizard interface using Settings Tests principles
   - Dual-platform support (WordPress plugin + standalone helpers)
   - Step-by-step configuration with validation and rollback
   - 3 installation modes (console credentials, full manual, INI import)
3. **Phases 6-8**: WordPress Admin Enhancement, Console Tools, Testing & QA
4. **Phase 9**: Legacy code deprecation and cleanup

## Technical Notes:

### Migration Strategy:
- **Backward Compatible**: Old get_option() calls still work during transition
- **Validation Built-in**: Every migration step includes comparison validation
- **Encrypted Credentials**: Database and console credentials stored encrypted
- **Precedence Rules**: Multiple option sources handled with clear precedence

### Testing Approach:
- Side-by-side comparison of old vs new values
- Real-time migration testing with rollback capability
- Credential validation with actual connection testing
- Admin interface for monitoring migration progress

## Preservation Requirements:
- âœ… All current admin pages and menus (preserved in new structure)
- âœ… All existing functionality (maintained through compatibility layer)
- âœ… Current settings field types (enhanced with new types)
- âœ… Credential handling system (improved with encryption)
- âœ… All current features enabled by default (no functionality loss)
